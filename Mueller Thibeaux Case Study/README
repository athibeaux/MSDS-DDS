Purpose:
The CEO and CFO of Budweiser are interested in insights gained from a dataset of craft beers and breweries in the United States. The datasets primarily give information
about the location of breweries, the ABV and IBU of beers offered at those breweries, and the styles of the beers. Since there is a lot of variety among breweries, 
it is helpful to start from a macro view and then drill down to examining specific variables and how knowing that information could help the company make future decisions
about new products, markets, or locations.
